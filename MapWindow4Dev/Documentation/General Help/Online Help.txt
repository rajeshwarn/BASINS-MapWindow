Questions from MapWindow users occur all the time, and some of these questions are stored on an online message center called a <a href'http://www.mapwindow.org/phorum'>forum</a>. 
<p>
A user can search the forum for answers related to their own question or a user can ask a question of their own that they would like answered. A typical response is a paragraph explaining the answer to a question, or the response references an earlier-similar question, or the response is a link to the requested data or some other online reference.
