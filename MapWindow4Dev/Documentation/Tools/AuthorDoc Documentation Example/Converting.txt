Any time AuthorDoc converts source into another format, the resulting files are placed in a 
directory named Out in the directory containing the project file basename.txt. Do not directly 
edit files in the Out directory because they may be overwritten next time a conversion is made.
After all necessary edits have been made to the source and some output has been made in Out, 
move the output to another directory before any manual editing is done.
