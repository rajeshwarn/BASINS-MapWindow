<h>HTML Help</h>

Before converting to HTML Help format (basename.chm) it is necessary to 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/tools/htmlhelp/wkshp/download.htm">download</a>
and install HTML Help Workshop from 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/tools/htmlhelp/chm/hh1start.htm">Microsoft</a>
or from <a href="ftp://hspf.com/pub/misc/htmlhelp.EXE">Aqua Terra</a>.

HTML Help project files (basename.hhp).

  <li>Project File (basename.hhp, the HTML Help project file)

  </ul>
