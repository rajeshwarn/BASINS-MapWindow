<h>Printable Word Document</h>

Microsoft Word must be installed before converting to a printable Word document (basename.doc).
Word 97 and Word 2000 have been tested with AuthorDoc. In addition, the file WB70EN32.TLB 
should be in the windows system directory. This file allows the use of WordBasic from Visual Basic.
