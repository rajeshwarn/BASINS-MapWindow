<h>Old-Style Windows Help</h>

Since HTML Help has supplanted old-style help, we reccommend using 
<a href="HTMLHelp">HTML Help</a> instead.
Before generating an old-style help file (basename.hlp, basename.cnt) 
Microsoft Word will need to be installed as discussed for 
<a href="Printable">printable Word documents</a>. 
Microsoft's Help Compiler for Windows (HCW) will also be needed, 
but it has become difficult to find on the web.
