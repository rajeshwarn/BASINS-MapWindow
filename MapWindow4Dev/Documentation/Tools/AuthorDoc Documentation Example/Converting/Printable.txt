<h>Printable Word Document</h>

Microsoft Word must be installed before converting to a printable Word document (basename.doc).
Word 97 and Word 2000 have been tested with AuthorDoc. In addition, the file WB70EN32.TLB 
should be in the windows system directory. This file allows the use of WordBasic from Visual Basic.
Download from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/WordDev/Articles/exe/WB70EN32.exe">Microsoft</a> or
from <a href="ftp://hspf.com/pub/misc/WB70EN32.TLB">Aqua Terra</a>.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Select the Convert option in the File menu
<li>Choose Printable Document
<li>Select whether or not you want 
  <ul>
  <li>a table of Contents (reccommended)
  <li>Footer Timestamps (sometimes useful for version control)
  </ul>
<li>If you already have the basename.doc file open that you are about to redo, close it
<li>Press the Convert button.
<li>The Out directory will now contain basename.doc - open it and see how you like the final product.
</ul>

Some manual post-processing will generally be helpful before printing because AuthorDoc is 
not very smart about deciding where page breaks should go. If there are many sections 
shorter than one page, it is probably desirable to remove several page breaks. Experiment 
with removing page breaks and see how it affects the table of contents. Where images fall 
near the edges of pages, it may be desirable to move the image to let the text flow more 
evenly and take up fewer pages. 
<p>
When manually editing the output, remember that any changes made will be lost when the document
is regenerated from source. Changes to the text should be made to the source rather than the
Word document so they will carry over to other formats and future versions of the document.
