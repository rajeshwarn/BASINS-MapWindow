Most source is simply plain text. Formatting is accomplished by inserting
tags into the text. AuthorDoc uses a few HTML tags that will be familiar to some
and easy to understand for all. The first tag of interest is the paragraph tag.
As in HTML, it is not usually important in AuthorDoc where you break lines while typing.
All carriage returns will be removed during conversion and only paragraph and break tags 
will break lines in the output.
<p>
Paragraphs are separated with the paragraph tag &lt;p&gt;<p>
This tag breaks the line and leaves a little vertical space before starting the next line. 
<p>
The break tag &lt;br&gt;<br>
breaks a line without without leaving added vertical space. 
<p>
Some characters with special meaning in HTML have to be written differently so they won't
be misinterpreted. If you want a &lt; sign to appear in the output, it has 
to be typed as &amp;lt; and a &gt; sign must be typed as &amp;gt; and an ampersand &amp;
has to be typed as &amp;amp;. This can be a source of strange errors during conversion.
If you convert your project and find that some of the document is missing or corrupted in 
the output, check for stray symbols that should be written differently or tags with a missing
&lt; or &gt;.
<p>
&lt;h&gt;Header of Section&lt;/h&gt;<br>
Header levels are handled by the converter. The indentation of the
filename in the project file determines the header level. This
makes it easy to reorganize documentation and to share sections
with documentation for other programs.
<p>
If a file does not contain a header, a default one will be
inserted based on the filename. For example, if the file
Abstract.txt just contains a paragraph of abstract and no &lt;h&gt; tag,
the string &lt;h&gt;Abstract&lt;/h&gt; will be inserted at the top of the file
during conversion. Many sections have the same name as the file, so this saves 
some typing. See the top of this page for an example of a header.
<p>
&lt;i&gt;italics&lt;/i&gt;<br>
<i>italics</i> 
<p>
&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;<br>
<b>bold</b> 
<p>
&lt;u&gt;underline&lt;/u&gt;<br>
<u>underline</u> 
<p>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;List<br>
&lt;li&gt;Of<br>
&lt;li&gt;Bullets<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
<ul>
<li>List
<li>Of
<li>Bullets
</ul>
<p>
&lt;ol&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Numbered<br>
&lt;li&gt;List<br>
&lt;li&gt;Of<br>
&lt;li&gt;Points<br>
&lt;/ol&gt;<br>
<ol>
<li>Numbered
<li>List
<li>Of
<li>Points
</ol>
<p>
&lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;<br>
Text to display in Courier fixed-width font, preserving line
breaks as they are typed. Helpful for text tables like:
&lt;pre&gt;
<pre>
DSN   Filename
  1   One.wdm
 10   Ten.wdm
134   OneThreeFour.wdm
</pre>
&lt;/pre&gt;<br>
This tag is also helpful for displaying code samples.
<p>
&lt;figure&gt;Label for a figure, to be included in table of figures&lt;/figure&gt;
<p>
&lt;img src="Screenshot.png"&gt;<br>
<img src="Screenshot.png"><br>
Include an image. If the image is not in the same directory, 
use paths such as 
&lt;img src="../../images/Screenshot.gif"&gt; or 
&lt;img src="/images/Screenshot.gif"&gt;
<p>
&lt;page&gt;<br>
Creates a manual page break in the printable output.
<p>
&lt;toc&gt;<br>
Builds a table of contents of the sections that are "children" of this one.
<p>
&lt;indexword="WDM"&gt;<br>
<indexword="WDM">
Creates a word in the HTML Help index that refers to this section
<p>
&lt;keyword="Introduction"&gt;<br>
<keyword="Introduction"><br>
Creates the same index entry that indexword creates, plus creates a 
button in HTML Help that pops open a window with links to all 
the other topics that share this keyword.
<p>
&lt;body bgcolor="0xffffff" background="SubtleLogo.gif"&gt;<br>
Override the current body style (if any) just for this file.
This is standard HTML and only has an effect in HTML and HTMLHelp.
<p>
<b>Hyperlinks</b>
<p>
&lt;a href="Introduction"&gt;Intro&lt;/a&gt;<br>
<a href="Introduction">Intro</a><br>
Hypertext link to another section. Relative paths can be used such as
&lt;a href="../OtherSection/Filename"&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt;
<p>
If the path starts with a slash, the correct relative path will be generated
during convert: &lt;a href="/icons/x.gif"&gt; might become &lt;a href="../../icons/x.gif"&gt;
If you are linking to a web page: <br>
&lt;a href="http://www.epa.gov/index.html"&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt;<br>
<a href="http://www.epa.gov/index.html">EPA</a><br>
If you want the web page to open in a separate browser window instead of the
help viewer: &lt;a href="http://www.epa.gov/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt;<br>
<a href="http://www.epa.gov/index.html" target="_blank">EPA</a>
<p>
Several tags can be inserted using the Tags menu. Most tags will be placed "around" 
the currently selected text in a helpful way. For example if the word click is selected in
a source file in the right pane, then Tags/Bold is selected, &lt;click&gt; will replace click.
<p>
It is possible to turn View/Formatting on and off. While on, some formatting such as bold, italic, 
and underline will be displayed, but the display may flicker during typing.
<p>
Do not include the following in your source files because they may confuse the converter:<br>
&lt;html&gt;<br>
&lt;head&gt;<br>
&lt;form&gt;<br>
<p>
Other HTML tags will be preserved in the HTML and HTML Help output
but will be lost in the printable document and old-style Windows
help file.
