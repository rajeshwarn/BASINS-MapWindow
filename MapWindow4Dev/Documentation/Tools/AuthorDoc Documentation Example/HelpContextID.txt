Help Context IDs are used in both HTML Help and old-style Help.
These IDs are mappings between section names and numbers. 
The numbers can be used for linking sections of help directly 
to parts of the interface of a program. If there is no need to be 
able to open a particular help section from a program (often when
the user presses F1 for help) then Help Context IDs are unnecessary.
<p>
The numbers are never visible in AuthorDoc or to the help user.
If Help Context IDs are generated while creating HTML Help output, they
will be placed in the basename.ID file and a corresponding section called 
[ALIAS] will appear in the basename.hhp file that is generated.
<p>
After the IDs have started being used in a program, copy basename.ID 
somewhere outside the Out directory in case it gets overwritten.
<p>
If new sections are added to the project or section names are changed after the 
IDs have started being used in a program, generate a new basename.ID file and manually merge the new entries into the old ID file. 
Keep all the old IDs, but update section names if they have changed and add
new sections at the end, giving them new IDs. After this is done, copy the 
newly edited basename.ID file into the Out directory, open HTML Help Workshop 
and compile basename.hhp into basename.chm.
