<h>AuthorDoc Introduction</h>
AuthorDoc is a system developed by Aqua Terra Consultants for creating documentation 
and converting it into various formats. While documentation is being written, 
it is saved in plain-text format with a little HTML formatting. This format is called 
"source" as in "source code" in programming. The AuthorDoc interface or any other 
text editing program can be used to create and edit source.
<p>
AuthorDoc can convert source into a printable Microsoft Word document (basename.doc), 
old-style Windows help (basename.hlp, basename.cnt), new style Windows HTML Help 
(basename.chm), or HTML pages suitable for placing on a website.
<p>
In this manual, the word <b>basename</b> is used to refer to the project name. 
This should probably be the name of the application being documented. 
Shorten the name if it is longer than 8 characters and do not include spaces.
For example, if the project is documentation for Word, read basename in the manual as Word.
