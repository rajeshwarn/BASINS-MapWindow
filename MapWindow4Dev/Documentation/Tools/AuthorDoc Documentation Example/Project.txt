<h>Project File</h>

The project file (basename.txt) contains a table of contents of the source files. 
The same basename is used when naming many of the output files, so choose a good name.
This file is read by AuthorDoc and displayed in the left pane as a tree control.
Clicking on a section name in the tree control opens that file for editing in the right pane.
<p>
Files are organized in folders that mirror the project file.
Indentation of two blank spaces in the project file defines subsections 
and folders as follows:
<p>
<pre>
If the project file contains:

Section1
  Section1.1
    Section1.1.1
  Section1.2
Section2
  Section2.1
Appendix
  Appendix1
  Appendix2

The directory system contains:

Section1.txt (General or introductory information for Section1)
Section1 is a folder containing:
  Section1.1.txt
  Section1.1 is a folder containing:
    Section1.1.1.txt   
  Section1.2.txt
Section2.txt
Section2 is a folder containing:
  Section2.1.txt
Appendix.txt
Appendix is a folder containing:
  Appendix1.txt
  Appendix2.txt
</pre>

The file and directory names must match the names in the project file. 
Outside AuthorDoc, the files and directories containing source may appear sorted by name or date.
Inside AuthorDoc, they always appear in the order they will be included in the converted output.
<p>
The project file can be changed several ways:
<ul>
<li>File menu item New Project starts a new project file
<li>File menu item New Section adds a new section after the one currently selected. 
    Create or navigate to a subdirectory to create a new subsection.
<li>Selecting the project in the tree view opens the project file for direct editing
<li>any text editor can open the project file as a text file
</ul>
After the project file is changed, make sure the files it refers to are moved 
or renamed to follow the changes. Any source file not mentioned in the project file 
will not be included in the conversion output.
