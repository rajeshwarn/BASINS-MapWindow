Most documentation is simply plain text. Formatting is accomplished by inserting
tags into the text. AuthorDoc uses a few HTML tags that will be familiar to some
and easy to understand for all. The first tag of interest is the paragraph tag.
As in HTML, it is not usually important in AuthorDoc where you break lines while typing.
All carriage returns will be removed during conversion and only paragraph and break tags 
will break lines in the output.
<p>
Paragraphs are separated with the paragraph tag &lt;p&gt;<p>
This tag breaks the line and leaves a little vertical space before starting the next line. 
<p>
The break tag &lt;br&gt;<br>
breaks a line without without leaving added vertical space. 
<p>
Capitalization of tags is not important. &lt;br&gt; and &lt;BR&gt; do exactly the same thing.
AuthorDoc conversion recognizes several other tags:
<p>
&lt;h&gt;Header of Section&lt;/h&gt;<br>
Headers are included in the table of contents and index in the output.
Usually there should be just one header in each file, at the top.
If a file does not contain a header, a default one will be inserted 
based on the filename. For example, if the file Abstract.txt just contains 
a paragraph of abstract and no &lt;h&gt; tag, the string 
&lt;h&gt;Abstract&lt;/h&gt; will be inserted at the top of the file
during conversion. Many sections have the same name as the file, so this saves 
some typing. See the top of this page for an example of a header. See the 
<a href="Style">Style</a> section for information about changing header appearance.
<p>
&lt;i&gt;italics&lt;/i&gt;<br>
<i>italics</i> 
<p>
&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;<br>
<b>bold</b> 
<p>
&lt;u&gt;underline&lt;/u&gt;<br>
<u>underline</u> 
<p>
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;List<br>
&lt;li&gt;Of<br>
&lt;li&gt;Bullets<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
<ul>
<li>List
<li>Of
<li>Bullets
</ul>
<p>
&lt;ol&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Numbered<br>
&lt;li&gt;List<br>
&lt;li&gt;Of<br>
&lt;li&gt;Points<br>
&lt;/ol&gt;<br>
<ol>
<li>Numbered
<li>List
<li>Of
<li>Points
</ol>
<p>
&lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;<br>
Text to display in Courier fixed-width font, preserving line
breaks as they are typed. Helpful for text tables like:
<pre>
DSN   Filename
  1   One.wdm
 10   Ten.wdm
134   OneThreeFour.wdm
</pre>
Also helpful for displaying code samples.
<p>
&lt;figure&gt;Label for a figure, to be included in table of figures&lt;/figure&gt;
<p>
&lt;img src="Screenshot.png"&gt;<br>
<img src="Screenshot.png"><br>
Include an image. If the image is not in the same directory, use relative
paths such as &lt;img src="../images/Screenshot.gif"&gt;
<p>
&lt;toc&gt;<br>
Builds a table of contents of the topics that are "children" of this one.
<p>
&lt;indexword="WDM"&gt;<br>
<indexword="WDM">
Creates a word in the HTML Help index that refers to this section
<p>
&lt;keyword="Introduction"&gt;<br>
<keyword="Introduction"><br>
Creates the same index entry that indexword creates, plus creates a 
button in HTML Help that pops open a window with links to all 
the other topics that share this keyword.
<p>
&lt;body bgcolor="0xffffff" background="SubtleLogo.gif"&gt;<br>
Override the current body style (if any) just for this file.
This is standard HTML and only has an effect in HTML and HTMLHelp.
<p>
<b>HYPERLINKS</b>
<p>
&lt;a href="Introduction"&gt;See Intro&lt;/a&gt;<br>
<a href="Introduction">See Intro</a><br>
Hypertext link to another section. Relative paths can be used such as
&lt;a href="../OtherSection/Filename"&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt;
<p>
If the path starts with a slash, the correct relative path will be generated
during convert: &lt;a href="/icons/x.gif"&gt; might become &lt;a href="../../icons/x.gif"&gt;
If you are linking to a web page: &lt;a href="http://epa.gov/index.html"&gt;
If you want the web page to open in a separate browser window instead of the
help viewer: &lt;a href="http://foo.gov/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;
<p>

Do not include the following in your source files, they will confuse the converter:<br>
&lt;html&gt;<br>
&lt;head&gt;<br>
&lt;form&gt;<br>

Other HTML tags will be preserved in the HTML and HTML Help output
but will be lost in the printable document and old-style Windows
help file.
