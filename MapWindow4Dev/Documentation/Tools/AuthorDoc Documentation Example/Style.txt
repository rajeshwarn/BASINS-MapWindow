Styles can change the appearance of your document by adding background 
colors and images and changing how headers are formatted. Currently, 
styles are only implemented for HTML and HTMLHelp output formats.
<p>
Defining one or more styles for a document is entirely optional.
If no styles are defined, defaults will be used.
<p>
One way to use styles is to make a style file that applies to the entire 
document. To do this for a project file basename.txt, create a new file 
called basename.sty in the same directory.
<p>
Default Style File:
<p>
<pre>
[Top]
&lt;hr size=7&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;sectionname&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr size=7&gt;

[Body]
bgcolor="#ffffff"
</pre>

The text following [Top] will be inserted at the top of each section.
The text following [Bottom] will be inserted at the top of each section.
The &lt;hr&gt; tag makes a horizontal line in HTML and the &lt;h2&gh; starts 
a second-largest-size HTML header. The tag &lt;sectionname&gt; will be replaced with the section name
during conversion. The text following [Body] will be inserted in the body tag for each page as in 
&lt;body bgcolor="#ffffff"&gt;. 
<p>
To make sections at different levels of the hierarchy have different styles, 
make a more complicated style file with numbers indicating which levels use which styles:
<p>
<pre>
[Top]
&lt;hr size=7&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;sectionname&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr size=7&gt;
1 &lt;img src="/TopLevel.png"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;sectionname&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
2 &lt;img src="/SecondLevel.png"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;sectionname&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

[Bottom]
&lt;hr&gt;

[Body]
bgcolor="#ffffff"
1 background="/bgimages/TopBackground.gif"
2 background="/bgimages/SecondBackground.gif"
</pre>

In this example, the same defaults are used for most levels, but the first and 
second level sections have customized headers and body tags, all including images, 
and the first level headers will be larger than all the rest using &lt;h1&gt; tags.
It is reccommended to always define a default style to avoid unexpected carryover
between styles. A default style must be defined before any level-specific styles.
<p>
Finally, if more flexibility is needed, a style file can be selected using a
style tag. The tag &lt;style Intro&gt; will read the file Intro.sty and use that 
style for the current section and all its subsections. When it is finished, 
the Intro style will be forgotten and the style previously in effect will be resumed.
