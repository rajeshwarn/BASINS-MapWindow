1.  This version is still under test and not ready for production mode usage, 
     if you decided to do so, please test throughly before deploy. 

2. This version uses PostGIS's client side tools to do the data interoperation because of the great speed they provide,
    but in the future (MapWindow5.0), We will change to use Chris's universal data access tool to perform this kind of
    operation.
